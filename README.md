# [Tabs to Markdown][1]

## A Web Extension that converts all open tabs into a list of links in a Markdown file.

### This extension can be useful for:

- documenting a web session without saving open tabs to `bookmarks`.
- documenting a web session when the amount of tabs to be recorded is excessive.
- transfer of web session to any device by means of a formatted markdown file.
- transfer of web session is needed and browser `sync` is not available.

---

### For developers:

- Use the npm package `web-ext` to run this project
- Use this command in the top directory

```bash
$ web-ext run --verbose
```
